This website's sole purpose is to provide a platform for all of my personal work and achievements. It will be a source
of information about me for potential recruiters and others interested in my work and capabilities. 

## UX

The target audience for this website is those looking for more information on me, in regard to my personal work and achievements. Anyone visiting this website will be hoping to see enough information about myself that they are able to come to a verdict as to whether I am someone they would be looking to hire.

I have done my best to ensure this website is user friendly for all users, regardless of their device. The webpage has been structured so that it will be responsive on any device that you choose to use. An area that has been looked at heavily in regard to UX is the navigation menu. Instead of the menu stacking and taking up a lot of room in smaller devices, I have designed it so that the entire menu will condense into a dropdown which can be opened by clicking the menu link.

One particularly useful part of my website is ability to view my CV at the click of a button. I have added this to make it easy for potential employers to see my full work details instantly.

**User Stories**

Speaking with some users who were testing my website, I asked them what they would like to achieve. They said:

1. As a visitor, I would like to be able to open the website on my iPhone 8
2. As a potential employer, I would like to be able to download Jack Bennett's CV

## Features

There are a few features available on my website that will make it easy for recruiters/people who have interest in my services. These have been listed below:

1. **Download CV** - In the navigation bar and the footer I have addded options to download my CV. At the click of a button you will be taken to an external page where my CV will be displayed.

2. **Contact Form** - A contact form has been added just above the footer so that people who want to get in contact with me have the option to do so.

**Technologies Used**

- HTML5
- CSS3

## JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing

Referring back to the user stories mentioned above, I needed to test that these were possible and whether my site provided what they wanted to see.

Starting with the first user story "As a visitor, I would like to be able to open the website on my iPhone 8", I essentially needed to make my website responsive for iPhone 8 users. At this point, it didn't make sense to only make my website responsive for a niche market if iPhone 8 users. I may as well go the full distance and make the website responsive for all devices. The way I did this in the code was by using media queries my external CSS stylesheet. To ensure that the CSS I was adding actually worked, I opened my website in a browser, inspected the code and used the Chrome device checker to filter through all the devices and make sure they looked responsive in each device. I can confirm that this was the case and my website appeared to be fully responsive.

The second user story was posed as a potential employer looking to potentially hire me. This was simply that they wanted to be able to view CV easily and at the touch of a button if possible. To do this I sinmply stored my CV within my website files, linked to it behind some text (with the option to open the CV in a new tab added) that read 'Download CV' and then added that within my navigation bar. I tested this by opening my website in a browser, clicking the link and ensuring it opened in a new tab.

**Bugs/Issues**



## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

## Credits

The contact form design was inspired by the contact form designed in the small 'Module 4' project prior to this one.
